        <li>Collier began uploading homemade, multi-instrumental content to YouTube in 2011, releasing, among others, vocal arrangements of "Pure Imagination", from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and in 2013, a multi-instrumental rendition of Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing". His activity caught the attention of Quincy Jones, who flew Collier out to the Montreux Jazz Festival where they met and then met with Herbie Hancock.</li>
        <li>In 2018, Collier began working on Djesse, a four-volume, 50-song album featuring more than two dozen artists and ensembles.</li>
    <li>Collier is the first British artist to receive a Grammy Award for each of his first four albums.</li>
